# 📋 Database Setup Required for Profile Persistence

## 🚨 Current Status: Profile Data Not Persisting

Your profile information isn't saving between page reloads because the database tables haven't been set up yet.

## ✅ Quick Fix (5 minutes):

### 1. Execute Database Schema
1. **Go to Supabase SQL Editor**: https://app.supabase.com/project/tkfaqwhhraroibxsxeih/sql/new
2. **Copy the schema**: 
   ```bash
   cat database/schema.sql | pbcopy
   ```
3. **Paste in SQL Editor** and click "Run"

### 2. Verify Setup
```bash
node database/verify-setup.js
```

## 🎯 What This Fixes:

- ✅ **Profile Persistence**: Your onboarding data will save permanently
- ✅ **User Progress**: No need to re-enter information on page reload
- ✅ **Real Authentication**: Move from mock mode to production mode
- ✅ **Data Storage**: All nutrition tracking, recipes, and plans will persist

## 🔄 Current Workaround:

The app currently works in "mock mode" with temporary data that doesn't persist. All functionality works, but data is lost on refresh.

## 📝 After Database Setup:

1. Complete onboarding once
2. Data persists across sessions
3. Real user profiles and preferences
4. All app features fully functional
